# EdViz 2019 - Workshop on Educational Data Visualization
## Held in conjunction with LAK 2019, ASU, Tempe, AZ

__Abstract__: The primary goal of this workshop is to produce open source data visualizations that help communicate results of learning analytics (LA) research to educators. Instructors are increasing their use of data to drive instruction, and various results of LA research are useful towards this end. However, the actionable insights discovered by the LA community are often inaccessible to educators due to their relative complexity. In this case, it is possible to use data visualization to communicate actionable insights about learners to optimize instruction effectively. Visualizations of learner data can make it easy for teachers and other education stakeholders to take evidence-based action. Organizers of the workshop intend to invite authors to describe and implement educational data visualizations that can aid decision making in online and offline classrooms. The workshop will result in a gallery of open source educational data visualizations that can be freely used by the LA community.

This repository contains the code of the papers published in the workshop. Different folders contain code of different papers. There is one extra folder that contains code of a data visualization that is not published in this workshop, but in other conference.

Here is a list of folders and their respective papers:

1. *students_at_a_glance* - "What do students know, how long does it take them to know?" at a Glance for Teachers and Instructional Designers
2. *trestle* - Visualizing the Solution Space of Educational Games using TRESTLE
3. *cronbachs_alpha* - Visualizing Cronbach's Alpha for a Large Number of Assessments
4. *curriculum_pacing* - Curriculum Pacing: A New Approach to Discover Instructional Practices in Classrooms (Published in ITS 2018,) Using Curriculum Pacing in LearnSphere to Visualize Student Learning Trajectories (Published in LearnSphere LAk Workshop 2019)

Every folder contains its own README that provides either location of the code or code and instructions to reproduce the data visualization on your end. Please contact the authors of the articles if you need further help in utilizing the visualization for your own work.
